# Determining the ball's location

## Solving for the initial and final location

</br>

Galileo's  polynomials  model acceleration, speed, and distance (sans wind and air resistance)

$$
x = v \underset{1}{}  t
$$

$$ v\underset{1}{} = \textnormal{starting speed of the ball on the horizontal plane}$$




Set the ball trajectory function equal to zero

$$
0 = {10x - 5x^2}
$$

The two solutions for this equation can be solved by using the quadratic formula -  *Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi*

$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
$$
